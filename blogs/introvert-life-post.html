                            <p class="post-meta">Posted on April 25, 2025</p>
                            
                            <div class="image-container">
                                <img src="../images/introvert-life1.png" alt="Introvert Life Illustration 1" />
                            </div>

                            <div class="justify-content">
                                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 1.1em;">From dry tongues to sly glances, <b>introverts have always been known to be typically observant, socially-awkward solitaries with rich inner lives.</b> Historically and culturally, they have faced criticism and isolation for being overly "quiet" or "awkward", but lately in 2025 more and more introverts have begun to speak out about their views on introversion and the introvert's struggle in workplace and social life, pivoting the world's biased view on the so-called "quiet people".</p>

                                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 1.1em;">However, as an introvert myself, I feel that <b>one commonly underestimated topic is the introvert's status and emotional state within the social pyramid, and its effect on the introvert's security and satisfaction about their inner worlds.</b> Today we'll be covering this topic, and every other subject matter about introversion that I feel are often neglected in conversations about introverts (along with some popular subjects as well).</p>

                                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 1.1em;">In 1921, the word "introvert" was first invented by a Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, which according to him means <b>"a person with a tendency to turn into their inner worlds for confirmation and satisfaction"</b>. As the years went by, the definition of "introvert" began to evolve, turn and occasionally lose touch with its origins. Numerous people began to see "introverts" as simply quiet, shy or reserved people. Even now, <b>the meaning of the term "introvert" is subjective and often contemplated about like a cavernous philosophical question.</b> Personally, I agree with Susan Chain's definition of "introvert": <b>someone who prefers to spend time alone or with close friends/family members rather than socialize with large groups of people.</b> According to her, the term "introvert" goes far beyond someone quiet or shy. These traits are only the face, or perhaps symptoms, of introversion. <b>There are frequently exceptions: introverts can be socially languid and extroverts are often social stumblers.</b> Unfortunately, most people did not understand this and chose instead to shame introverts for not "raising their hands in the conversation", making them recoil into rabbit holes of insecurities, further endangering their relationships and social status. Now, with a more accurate and advanced view upon introversion, society has grown to accept introverts more than before, but I've noticed that my classmates, family members, friends and social mates still have not evolved their view upon introversion. I'll be talking about it in the following paragraphs, and maybe through them you can relate.</p>

                                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 1.1em;">The largest thing I've noticed about my community's view upon introversion is their ignorance, and not intended meanness, towards introverts. From first grade to 2025 I have always been told to "raise my hand more often" and "answer more questions during class time". Has anyone ever considered that this may not be the adequate teaching method for everyone? Has anyone ever considered that, as introverts, voluntarily raising our hands to answer a question in front of everyone as a type of social activity, is similar to asking an extrovert to sit alone all day doing quizzes as a learning method? Oh no, no, god forbid, we only listen to extroverts because they are typically more outspoken. Has anyone ever considered that the quiet girl in the corner is more than just "quiet?" Has anyone ever even tried to peek at what's beneath her surface? Oh no, no, because "quiet" is apparently the defining personality trait of a person now. I'm sorry if I sound angry, but things is, I am angry, and isn't that the whole point? <b>An introvert is so much more than a mellow, affable, shy person. An introvert gets angry, throws punches, and chases ambitions. "Introverted" is not a synonym for "submissive".</b> And yet, psychologically and culturally, the human race has been taught that "quiet" is a symptom for "submission", therefore forming the stereotype that introverts are non-argumentative, amiable and possessing of less ambition than extroverts. That is perhaps the worst thing you can say about an introvert. <b>Automatically assuming somebody has less ambition and dreams simply because of their surface persona is, on some levels, a crime, and deeply hurtful towards reputation, security, emotional health and yes, ego.</b> Overall, mistaking "introversion" for "submission", automatically assuming an introvert is less ambitious or feisty, and not comprehending the adequate learning methods for introverts are deeply hurtful, shown not only through significant events like national debates, but also smaller everyday occurrences like raising hands or class discussions.</p>

                                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 1.1em;">Now let's talk about an introvert's actual status in the social pyramid. In my school and especially in my grade, the "flirtier", more "sassy" and "confident" girls (they're none of that) win favor in the grade and earn the place as top dog within the pack. Meanwhile, the "cool", "secure", "flirtier" boys gain a throne beside the girls, after which both genders would interact in a manner not unlike that of a rat. Since my school has a major student selection issue in lower grades (note: just my opinion, offering constructive feedback here), meaning teachers are choosing to welcome extroverted, talkative students into the school and ignoring quieter ones, the majority of my grade are extroverted, confident, so-called "top dogs", if not sidekicks or favor-earning chihuahuas. So, what about the rest of us? What about all the quieter introverts, the ones who actually don't want to waste time playing games like slapping a person's wrist after you lose at rock paper scissors? What about all the introverts who don't want to be gross by flirting, or brag by acting self-assured, or offend by being sassy? What about the ones who have had their images irrevocably solidified just for being themselves, for being introverts? They, are the underdogs of the social pyramid, the underestimated scapegoats who never received their recognition, merely because they didn't seek out attention. This biased social structure does not affect career results or statistical academics, but it is, quite definitely, <b>significantly damaging to an introvert's mental health.</b> Of course, this is just one situation, there are countless others such as a teacher (Mr. Gary—not his real name) organizing a "party" at my school as a "reward", where the whole school walks around and socialize. In this case, Mr. Gary has entirely ignored the one to two people out of three people, who are introverts and typically don't feel comfortable with socializing. As shown by that example, because of being quiet and often wordless, introverts have become the damaged victims of society.</p>

                                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 1.1em;">In the above two paragraphs, I highlighted several situations that can be hurtful towards introverts, and dissected my grade's social structure as a representation of society's interpretation and attitude towards introverts, showing them not as statistics but as individuals. Now I will compose <b>a specific list of common situations introverts face that often dent their egos, reputations, social status and security:</b></p>

                                <div class="personality-type">
                                    <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding-left: 2em; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 1.1em;">
                                        <li>Being told to raise hands, raise some more, and raise even more</li>
                                        <li>Being ignored in teamwork and group work despite being the strongest member</li>
                                        <li>Not receiving the credit deserved in teamwork or even individual work</li>
                                        <li>Automatically assumed to have less ambition and determination</li>
                                        <li>Expected not to argue back or have ideas of their own</li>
                                        <li>Being told to, um, excuse me—open up. I mean, what the heck does that even mean? Are we supposed to just talk more about the weather?</li>
                                        <li>Automatically assumed to be "boring"X(</li>
                                        <li>Popularity decreased because of being "quiet"</li>
                                        <li>Defined by everyone else to only be "quiet"</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </div>

                                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 1.1em;">And that's it. That's the list of events that I can think of right now, though there are hundreds more that I have not covered. However, now we will put that aside, and move on to the four central introversion personality types I summarized, along with each of their assets and weaknesses. These are the four personality types introverts can possess (according to my own thoughts). If you find my version inaccurate or untrue, I recommend checking our the MBTI personality test.</p>

                                        <li>AOPAs are socially alert and usually wary, but they're observant and mindful enough that they're likable.</li>
                                        <li>They're practical and throw in compliments when necessary.</li>

                                        <li>This type of introvert is also typically socially comfortable.</li>
                                        <li>They are blunt and unflinchingly honest, but in a non-judging and pleasing way</li>
                                        <li>They are typically relatively comfortable in social circles.</li>

                                        <li>CWTHs are pretty much the opposite of ABPDs. Both personalities are blunt, honest, except CWTHS are NOT that likable.</li>

                                        <li>They are unflinchingly honest (perhaps in a negative way this time)</li>

I just want to say, each type is unique, interesting, essential and unmissable. Each of them deserve to be proud about.</p>

                                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 1.1em;">Before I wrap up this article, I have one last thing to talk about (or list): I know that introverts are often shamed for being themselves, but there are so many genius people or even gods from movies and books that, to the reader, is likable but are not the most popular in their own worlds. I've listed some of them out below (There are just too many to count. :)</p>
