                            <p class="post-meta">Posted on April 1, 2024</p>
                            
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; text-align: left; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 1.1em;">Writing about a young author's journey has been both challenging and deeply personal. Here's a peek into my writing process!</p>

                            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; text-align: left; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 1.1em;">I started out with the inspiration of this story when I hoped to craft a realistic fiction novel featuring a girl's complex relationship with her father. However, I soon realized that this girl has another story to tell: how she pursued her dreams and published her novel.</p>

                            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; text-align: left; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 1.1em;">So, with this idea in mind, I began a story interwining between family relationships and personal developments. The main character of this story, twenty-two-year old Olivia Otter, is very close to my heart: she seems quiet and mellow on the outside, but inside she is sarcastic, clever and ceaselessly ambitious. She is also an INTJ, like me!</p>

                            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; text-align: left; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 1.1em;">A lot of major changes did occur to her character arc (and is still occuring!) as I developed the novel. I want her to be honest, witty and deeply relatable, perhaps just a tad reserved. It's difficult for me to balance this character arc with the overall life-oriented plot, so I was and perhaps still am a bit lost upon the storyline.</p>

                            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; text-align: left; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 1.1em;">However, I have found that planning the novel out carefully on paper (using a bubble map/board game-outlined map) is miraculously helpful. Following that outline, I am currently nearly finished with the third draft of this book.</p>

                            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; text-align: left; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 1.1em;">Looking back, I have realized that perhaps I based a part of Olivia on me. And that's not the most important thing. The most important thing is, I have grown with her.</p>
