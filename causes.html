                                <h3>Gender Equality</h3>
                                <p class="cause-text">
                                    I am passionate about promoting gender equality through my writing and art. Countless gender discriminations have been occurring everywhere in 2025: workplaces, villages, cities, palaces, and our regular homes. Casual acts of gender flippancy and disrespect can influence our overall attitude about women, so I hope to improve that by bringing awareness to this difficult-to-navigate tightrope called gender equality. My works often feature strong female protagonists who challenge societal norms and expectations (an example would be Violet Domely from Rising Melodies) I believe in creating stories that empower readers of all genders to pursue their dreams without limitations.

                                <h3>Animal Rights</h3>
                                <p class="cause-text">
                                    I am particularly concerned about the welfare of animals in slaughterhouses, especially chickens, pigs and cows. I believe that although issues of gender inequality and racial discrimination are valid and important, animal welfare - particularly in slaughterhouses - often lacks the same powerful advocacy voices.
                                </p>
                                <p class="cause-text highlight">
                                    Every second of every day, animals endure unimaginable suffering:
                                    • Male chickens gassed or killed for being "unprofitable"
                                    • Chickens chemically fattened until their legs fail
                                    • Cows confined in spaces too small to turn
                                    • Pigs mutilated and force-fed in atrocious conditions
                                    • Rabbits subjected to cruel cosmetic testing
                                    • Livestock skinned while conscious
                                </p>
                                <p class="cause-text">
                                    IT IS TIME WE MAKE SOME CHANGES. My proposed solution starts with strengthening the voices opposing these acts of cruelty. We need everyone to join the movement - and you don't have to do anything physically, all you have to do is care. This can be amplified when influential voices speak out about the issue.
                                </p>
                                <p class="cause-text">
                                    A crucial next step is promoting artificial meat and plant-based alternatives like Seitan. While the transition won't be immediate, encouraging slaughterhouse industries to convert to artificial meat production will help create lasting change. Safety-tested artificial meat reduces our exposure to chemicals and animal-borne diseases, while helping the environment and potentially improving various countries' economies.

                                <p class="cause-text emphasis">
                                    Right now, I may not have a loud enough voice, but I can care. I will express that care through my books, including an upcoming novel about raising awareness of slaughterhouse cruelty. This world is imperfect enough. Animals deserve our respect, and I'm going all in to help complete this ring of mutual respect in our constantly evolving 21st century.
