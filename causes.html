                                <h3>Gender Equality</h3>
                                <p class="cause-text">
                                    I am passionate about promoting gender equality through my writing and art. Countless gender discriminations has been occuring everywhere in 2025: workplaces, villages, cities, palaces and our regular homes. Casual acts of gender flippancy and disrespect can influence our overall attitude about women, so I hope to improve that by bringing awareness to this difficult-to-navigate tightrope called gender equality. My works often feature strong female protagonists who challenge societal norms and expectations (an example would be Violet Domely from Rising Melodies) I believe in creating stories that empower readers of all genders to pursue their dreams without limitations.

                                <h3>Animal Rights</h3>
                                <p class="cause-text">
                                    I am particularly concerned about the welfare of animals in slaughterhouses, especially chickens, pigs and cows. I believe that although issues of gender inequality and racial discrimination - a few of the most major social issues occuring this year - are valid; they already have powerful voices of determined people adovating for change. On the other hand, slaughtherouse animal abuse (particularly in the fields of lobbying), has a wisp of a voice, a whisper of revolution. Every second of every minute of everyday, male chickens are being gassed or smashed to death because of their "unprofitable" gender; female chickens are being injected with chemicals to make them fatter, to the extent that their legs can't support the weigt of their body; cows are being contained in stock spaces so tiny they are unable to turn around; baby pigs are having their tails being cut off in fear of them biting their tails off themselves out of boredom; more elderly pigs are being kept in atrocious conditions and having food stuffed down their unwilling throats every day; rabbits are being lab tested on cruelly simply because of make-up products; livestock are skinned while being fully conscious (so as to save expanses on stun tools); delicacies such as foie gras are being seized with unspeakable, despicable means out of livestock...Simply thinking about all this cruelty human beings are capable off is provoking. IT IS TIME WE MAKE SOME CHANGES. Here is a brief summary of my proposed solution to this issue: To start, I believe that strengthing the voice objecting to these unspeakable acts of cruelty is essential. We need everyone to join in the movement: and you don't have to do anything corporeally, all you have to do is care--spare a little bit of your heart for this. This step can be better achieved when there are more influential people speaking out about the issue (hypothetically speaking, Taylor Swift). That would encourage their admirers and other crowds to at least consider joining in. After that, a crucial step is to promote the use of artificial meat and Seitan. That will reduce the amount of slaugterhouses needed. It will not be a smooth transition, the number of people working in the slaughterhouse is too high for the slaughterhouse industry to fade from the picture, but encouraging more and more slaughterhouse industrilists to convert to the artificial meat industry will help. Once tested to be safety-garaunteed, artificial meat actually reduces the amount of chemicals/animal diseases we consume daily. If that were accomplished, I believe that animals will live in a world with a little less brutality, and a lot more love. Helping them benefits us as well: as I said, fake meat reduces the amount of diseases and chemicals found on such foods. Also, once the fake meat industry begins to build up, multiple countries' financial situation will improve. Meanwhile, saving animals will benefit the environment, which as we all know, will lead to benefitting us. It will be a vexing, wearisome and bumpy process, but I believe that it is worth it. Right now, with not a loud enough voice, I cannot do any of that: but I can care. And I will express that care through all of my books. I am currently planning to publish a novel in following years about a young boy bringing awareness to slaugtherhouse chicken cruelty. So, in conclusion, I am ready to devote myself to this issue, to put my entire heart into this action using my artwork. Why? Because this world is imperfect enough. It is cruel enough. Animals are in enough pain already. That is why animals deserve our respect. Do we deserve theirs? I hope so, but I am not sure. That is why I will try to complete this ring of mutual respect in a constantly evolving, industrializing, spinning, bolting, ceasless world of the twenty-first century--I'm going all in.
